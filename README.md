Languages we learned and used:
    1. HTML: the basic format of the pages was initially written in HTML which we learned in classromm as well as from w3schools (recommended by our teachers).

    2. CSS: css is a styling language which helps us in styling the html page and makes it appear readable, more used friendly, clear and attractive.

    3. JS: JavaScript was used for validation and making the web-pages interacive, where html&css gave structure and style JS helped the site to interact with the users.

    4. Node JS: allowed us to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. Maintaing the backend of the project.

    5. EJS: Embeded JavaScript lets us embed JavaScript code in a template language that is then used to generate HTML. All the pages are of the extension '.ejs'.
